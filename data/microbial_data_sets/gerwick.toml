# Dataset configuration
# ---------------------
#
# Generally speaking the dataset layout the application expects matches the structure
# of the output from a GNPS job with TODO TODO TODO settings, plus a few extra
# files from other sources. If you have a dataset in the required structure, 
# typically all you will need to do is tell nplinker where the root directory
# is located. Otherwise you can customise the locations of the individual elements
# using the various override settings below. 
#
# The layout is as follows (see the documentation for more details):
# <root>
#   |   (METABOLOMICS DATA)
#   |- clusterinfo_summary/<UID>.tsv (spectrum metadata)
#   |- metadata_table/metadata_table-00000.txt (TODO)
#   |- networkedges_selfloop/<UID>.selfloop (the "edges" file for spectra network)
#   |- quantification_table/quantification_table-00000.csv (original MS1 data, optional? TODO)
#   |- "extra" spectrum metadata .csv file TODO
#       (GENOMICS DATA)
#   |- antismash/*.gbk (antiSMASH GenBank files for the BGCs in the dataset)
#   |- bigscape/<classes subfolders> (BiG-SCAPE clustering/annotation files in their subfolders)

# format, with nested directories for each strain
